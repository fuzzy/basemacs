* Base Emacs Configuration

This configuration has a very minimal set of goals, and is likely not where you want to start. Unless you're looking to roll
your own emacs configuration and would like a starting point that stays out of your way. BaseMacs provides a set of helper
functions for making a custom configuration of emacs a little bit nicer (opinionated statement). That's it.

** What does BaseMacs provide?

BaseMacs will bootstrap straight.el and use-package, and installs emacs-dashboard by default. Nothing else. If you enable
the other builtin layers, additional packages may get installed. For example, there is support in this framework, for
generating =hydras=. However, the hydra package is not bootstrapped by default. If you enable that layer, then the packages
will get installed on the next restart of emacs, and you'll be able to use the hyra helpers.

** Usage

The recommended way to use BaseMacs is to clone this repository, drop your init.el in, and everything should just work as
usual at that point. Unless you have code that performs the bootstrapping operations or package installs noted above, you
should notice no difference, except now you have a dashboard with a friendly message telling you the available custom
keybindings.

At this point you can start migrating your configuration to use the helper functions to generate custom hydras, add key
bindings to your custom keymap and get them automatically added to the dashboard help output, build customization menus to
handle configuring all of your options. Go nuts!

** Getting started

I'll endeavor to fill this section out with a few basic examples to help get you started, as soon as possible.

** Helper functions

As well, I will also get the helper functions and example usage documented here.
